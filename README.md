# Born to Be 🖼️
Born to Be is a passion project of mine to showcase the different types of artworks I make. It provides music in the background as well as an interactive poster/gallery for viewers. 

## Features

- Relaxing Background Music 🎶
- Interactive Poster/Gallery 🤩
- Personal Artist Statement 🎭
- Play Screen Drawing Tool 🖍️
- Typographic/Visual Art using Illustrator & Photoshop 🎨

## Overview

The initial screen will be a "HOME" screen with two buttons: Gallery & Artist Statement. The initial screen is also coded with stars in the background to emphasize the concept of dreams. Gallery leads to the interactive poster/gallery with various buttons that showcase my artwork over the years. There will be a button in the Gallery that leads you to a "PLAY" screen with a drawing tool. Finally, the Artist Statement button leads you to a personal message from me to the viewers.
